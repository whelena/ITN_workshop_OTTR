### Getting started

Create your repository by clicking on the `Use this Template` button at [OTTR_Template_Website repository](https://github.com/jhudsl/OTTR_Template_Website)

![](resources/images/create-repo.png)

You'll need to make your repository `public`.

### Set your GH_PAT

To enable the GitHub actions, your repository needs to be setup in a specific way.

For OTTR GitHub actions to run, they need to have credentials through a personal access token.

1. Set up your own personal access token [following these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token). Keep this personal access token handy for the next step.

2. In your new OTTR_Template_Website derived repository, go to Settings > Secrets > Actions. Click `New Repository Secret`. In the window opened, name this new secret `GH_PAT` and paste the personal access token in the box below.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Clicking on settings", echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/setting_gh_pat.png")
```

### Protect branches


Although this isn't entirely required, its strongly recommended that you use these settings to protect your `main` branches.

Click on settings in the far upper right corner:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Clicking on settings", echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/settings.png")
```
Click on branches:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Clicking on settings", echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/branches.png")
```
Click the add rule button.

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Adding rule", echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/add_rule.png")
```
Type "main" as the branch name pattern:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "adding main branch rule", echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/main_branch.png")
```
Click on the following boxes to require pull requests before merging:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "modify branch rules", echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/branch_rule.png")
```
