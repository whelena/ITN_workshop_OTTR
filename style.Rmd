## Navigation bar

To change the part of the navigation bar that says "OTTR Web", modify the title within the `_site.yml` file.


```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Change nav bar", echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/navbar.png")
```


## Overall theme

To change the color scheme/fonts of the website modify the `theme` in the `_site.yml` file (see [here](https://www.datadreaming.org/post/r-markdown-theme-gallery/) for options):

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Change theme", echo = FALSE, out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/theme.png")
```

## Change the favicon

The small image that shows up on the browser can also be changed.

You can make a small image to replace the existing one by going to https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/ and uploading an image that you would like.

Next, simply replace the image called `favicon.ico` in the `images` directory within the `resources` directory with the image you just created and downloaded from the favicon converter website.

## Additional changes

To make additional changes to the style, you can modify the `styles.css` file with css code. This [website](https://www.w3schools.com/css/) has great information about css code.

As an example if you wanted to change the color of the blue line to green you could change where it says `lightblue` to `lightgreen` in the `styles.css` file. You can also use a hex color code like those that can be found at this [website](https://htmlcolorcodes.com/), such as `#00FF9E` to get a specific shade. 


```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Change color of line", echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/blue.png")
```

Note that if you change the css file with a new element that is not already defined like `body` then you would need to do it as done with the `banner` element. This was then added to the index.Rmd file by using:

```
<div class = "banner">
Banner text!  
</div>
```
