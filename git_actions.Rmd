## Spelling and Style Action

You may find that you have spelling errors if you get the following message from your pull request (PR):

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "spelling issue PR image", echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/spelling.png")
```

If this happens, click the "Download the errors here." link. This will take you to a table with words that the check thought were misspelled, as well as what file they occurred in and the lines in that file.

Add words that are not actually misspelled to the `dictionary.txt` file located in the `resources` directory. It's a good idea to try to keep this in alphabetical order.

For words that are indeed misspelled, fix the errors and push your changes to your PR. 

You should then see that your PR has a different message that tells you that you have no spelling errors.
