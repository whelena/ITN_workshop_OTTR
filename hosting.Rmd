## Hosting Setup

To host your website on GitHub, you will need to go to settings and click on the pages tab.

Again to go to settings click on the far upper right corner:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Clicking on settings", echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/settings.png")
```

Click on Pages:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "Clicking on pages", echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/pages.png")
```

Select the main branch and the root directory and press save. Be sure to also check the "Enforce HTTPS" box. Afterwards your repository should look like this:

```{r, fig.align='center', fig.alt= "setup website hosting", echo = FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("resources/images/website_setup.png")
```
